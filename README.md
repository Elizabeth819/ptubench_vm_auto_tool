# ptubench_vm_auto_tool
Create a new VM node for PTU benchmarking

You don't need to create VM in the portal, saving the processes to choose VM and region,
wait to start and then configure the SSH connection from local network.

1. First run the ptu_vm.sh in the local laptop to create a new VM
   the script can transit the ptu benchmarking automation script to the VM just created.
   bash ptu_vm.sh create|delete
   create: it can detect the resource group name and VM name existant so as to save time for follow-up creations.

2. Use the command generated by the first script and login to the VM to execute the PTU benchmarking script
